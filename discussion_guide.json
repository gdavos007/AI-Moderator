My name is Justin Wallin, and I run a research organization that works throughout the nation. Our goal tonight is to have an open discussion about your perceptions about some topics that may be important to your communities. You were invited because you are a voter, who is considered to be relatively informed about public policy issues. Our discussion this evening will be audio and video-taped… For privacy reasons, we will address each other by the letters and/or numbers on your tile. Understanding this, may I quickly confirm that it is all right with each of you to record this discussion? Everyone please signify your permission by saying, 'yes' as I call your name. Your participation in this group is entirely voluntary, and you are free to leave at any point if you absolutely must. However, only those who participate in the entire session will receive the incentive following the session. This discussion is conducted for research purposes only—no one will try to sell you anything.",

Your participation is very important and side conversations are distracting—please keep focused. There's no such thing as a wrong answer—share honest views, positive or negative. If you agree or disagree, please elaborate and tell us why. We'll move the conversation along at times to cover everything. My role is not to express opinions, but I may press a little and bring up ideas to react to.",
