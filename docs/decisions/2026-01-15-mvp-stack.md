title: MVP web + api stack for demo

# Decision
Implement the demo as a Vite + React web app (`apps/web`) with a minimal
Node `http` in-memory API (`services/api`). This keeps the UI responsive
and provides deterministic eventing without external services.

# Alternatives considered
1) **Single static HTML/JS app only**
   - Pros: Fastest to ship, no server.
   - Cons: No deterministic API eventing; harder to mirror requirements.
2) **React app + Express API**
   - Pros: Familiar patterns and middleware.
   - Cons: Adds dependency surface area for a quick MVP.
3) **Next.js full-stack app**
   - Pros: One repo, API routes co-located.
   - Cons: More setup overhead for MVP and harder to keep changes small.

# Rationale
The chosen approach balances speed with a clear separation of UI and
deterministic eventing while avoiding extra dependencies. It also aligns
with the README architecture notes without overbuilding.

# Tradeoffs
- In-memory API state resets on restart.
- No auth; organizer role is client-selected for demo.

# How we'll know if this was wrong
- If demo needs persistent sessions or auth, we should revisit a fuller
  API stack (Express/Nest) or integrated framework (Next.js).

# How to validate
- Run both services and confirm the UI can start a session and raise-hand
  events are recorded in the API log.
